# Overview


This project was to help me study for my quizzes in one of my databases class. The project is a simple concept where the program asks the user if they would like to
study keywords or definitions. Depending on the answer the user will then get asked to answer the questions and it will show you the result at the end of the practice.

# Web Pages


I have two pages in this application. 
The first page will prompt the user for what kind of studying they would like to do (keywords or definitions).
Second page will call a class that creates a card receiving a keyword and a definition. 

# Development Environment
I used Intellij and w3schools.
For the languages I used Kotlin.

# Useful Websites

# Future Work
* Make it easier to add new keywords and definitions.
* Transfer over to android studio so it can be more interactive.
* Add a flashcard that will flip
